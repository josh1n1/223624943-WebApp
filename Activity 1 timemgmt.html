            <p> its important to develop an effective time  management and study techniques that help you retain most information</p>

    <ul style= "list-style: none;">
        <li>1.The SQR Method</li>
        <p>The SQ3R method is a reading comprehension technique that helps students identify important facts and retain information within their textbook. </p>
        
        <li>2.Retrieval Practice</li>
        <p> is based on the concept of remembering at a later time. Recalling an answer to a question improves learning more than looking for the answer in your textbook. </p>

        <li>3.Spaced Practice</li>
        <p>Spaced practice (also known as “distributed practice”) encourages students to study over a longer period of time instead of cramming the night before. When our brains almost forget something, they work harder to recall that information.</p>

        <li>4.The PQ4R Method</li>
        <p>This method takes an active approach to learning that improves memorization and understanding of the topic. Similar to the SQ3R method above, PQ4R is an acronym that stands for the six steps in the process.</p>

        <li>5.The Feynman Technique</li>
        <p>The Feynman Technique is an efficient method of learning a concept quickly by explaining it in plain and simple terms. Its based on the idea, “If you want to understand something well, try to explain it simply.”</p>

        <h3>conclusion</h3>
        <p>if you want to improve your study techniques this will be helpful to you make your study more productive </p>
